Abstraction Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism

//Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

//Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).

//Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It also allows the same method to behave differently based on the objectâ€™s type.

//Abstraction is the principle of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features
